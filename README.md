# Airtime Queen Weekly Rewards Distribution

This project runs an automated weekly cron job to distribute rewards to users based on their average savings token balance (TWAB) from a vault contract. Rewards are dispersed as the vaultâ€™s savings token using the Disperse protocol on the Base network.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun with TypeScript
- **Blockchain SDK**: viem
- **Test Runner**: Vitest
- **Database**: Postgres with Kysely ORM
- **Local Test Chain**: Anvil

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd airtime-queen-rewards
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:
   ```
   ANVIL_URL=http://localhost:8545
   RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
   CHAIN_ID=8453
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/airtime_queen
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   REWARD_APY_BPS=500
   MULTICALL3=0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11
   TWAB_CONTROLLER=0x7e63601F7e28C758Feccf8CDF02F6598694f44C6
   VAULT=0xCa69657fF5E4350BAE44F37524F2C6621Ff0735B
   ZARP=0xb755506531786c8ac63b756bab1ac387bacb0c04
   DISPERSE=0x7fca60de6d574548b4ce427ba53551e399ffb1f7
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**
   Make sure you have a Postgres database running and the `DATABASE_URL` is configured correctly in your `.env` file.
   Then, run the migration script to create the necessary tables (`users` and `job_runs`):
   ```bash
   bun run src/db/migrate.ts
   ```
   After running the migration, you may want to seed your `users` table with data for testing purposes.

## Running the Cron Job

To run the weekly distribution script manually:

```bash
bun src/weekly-distribute.ts
```

### System Cron Configuration

To run the script automatically every week, you can add a new entry to your system's crontab.

1. Open the crontab for editing:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add the following line to run the script every Sunday at 2:00 AM:
   ```cron
   0 2 * * 0 /path/to/your/bun /path/to/your/project/src/weekly-distribute.ts
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/bun` with the actual path to your Bun executable and `/path/to/your/project` with the absolute path to the project directory.

## Testing

To run the tests, you need to have Anvil running in a separate terminal:

```bash
anvil
```

Then, run the tests using Vitest:

```bash
bun test
```

The tests will use the Anvil fork to simulate the Base network and a mock TWAB controller to test the reward distribution logic.
